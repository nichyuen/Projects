"Say, &quot;O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah .&quot; But if they turn away, then say, &quot;Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].&quot;<br>(Quran 3:64)<br><br>Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them -  out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in [taking] account.<br>(Quran 3:19)<br><br>And whoever desires other than Islam as religion -  never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.<br>(Quran 3:85)<br><br>They have certainly disbelieved who say, &quot; Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary&quot; while the Messiah has said, &quot;O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.&quot; Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.<br>(Quran 5:72)<br><br>They have certainly disbelieved who say that Allah is Christ, the son of Mary. Say, &quot;Then who could prevent Allah at all if He had intended to destroy Christ, the son of Mary, or his mother or everyone on the earth?&quot; And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates what He wills, and Allah is over all things competent.<br>(Quran 5:17)<br><br>But the Jews and the Christians say, &quot;We are the children of Allah and His beloved.&quot; Say, &quot;Then why does He punish you for your sins?&quot; Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the [final] destination.<br>(Quran 5:18)<br><br>The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.<br>(Quran 5:75)<br><br>They have certainly disbelieved who say, &quot; Allah is the third of three.&quot; And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.<br>(Quran 5:73)..",0.0,0.1893425,0.06669625,0.22063516,0.027170537,0.1578576322,0.0

"His way of earning money was by working as a clown at kids birthday parties. Despondency kicked in as he got bullied for his career, so he quit. Underneath the clown mask, was a middle aged man with mid-length hair and a beard. But what lied underneath that mask was more than just an age and hair; there was a shattered man, a man with a wanted place to go. His desired satisfaction of fitting in with the rest is eluded. Well, after quitting he was happy and became more happy, as the eyes formed more prominent and if you&#39;re wondering the true reason of why he quit, well, he got sucker-punched which lead to an ugly smile of no teeth, so, he went through surgery and was implanted with fake, real-looking, nice shiny-white teeth. He smiled even harder with new and increased confidence, which made his eyes squint and teeth lift. His attractive smile, enkindled infatuation. A girl was aroused and went to talk to him, he became nervous and produced sweat, you could see a large drop dancing down his forehead. Happed in a drowned catharsis, a innocent smile was situated on his face and basorexia transpired. He went in for the kiss and used tongue. They got married and lived happily ever after.",0.0,0.4269174,0.4962726,0.010951365,0.010602405,0.3540925769999999,0.0

"Had to come back to this song after a beautiful memory resurfaced. For those who want a slightly funny story: friends had a little brother and he would NOT stop acting up. Kicked out of schools, suspended, didn‚Äôt stop thinking he was hard. No punishment worked. So, in order to break down the ego we gave him a haircut of random things we thought were funny. In big boldened letters, the back of his head shouted ‚ÄúBitch Lasagna‚Äù at anybody who‚Äôd look. Stayed that way for months too. <br><br>TLDR; put bitch lasagna in a haircut cause a kid was acting up.",2.0,0.2667042,0.18355975,0.059311368,0.03373172,0.2101960013,0.0

"<b>How much lasagna to feed all T-Series subscribers</b><br><br>It takes 25 square feet of wheat to make a day&#39;s worth of lasagna for 1 person. Assuming all 220 million of T-Series&#39; subs ate a day&#39;s worth of lasagna, It would take 5.5 Billion square feet of wheat to make all of the lasagna. It would take 200 square miles of wheat just to feed them the noodles in lasagna. Assuming we used pork (no beef for Indians), We would need about 1 pound of meat. We would need to raise about 800,000 pigs, which would take 45 square miles. Feeding the pigs would take almost 1500 square miles.<br>Now, assuming we made pure tomato sauce, we would need 2 cups of tomato sauce for each person, so 440 million cups of tomato sauce. You need 15 tomatoes for one cup, so 2 plants. We need 6.6 billion tomatoes, or 880 million tomato plants.

Also whoever owns that horse you have done an amazing job making sure he won‚Äôt spill or won‚Äôt freak you on the reins  flopping around his neck good job because if I tried to do that I would probably get bucked off because I‚Äôm riding  a green horse oh joy,0.0,0.28425202,0.24767025,0.008620501,0.010809537,0.2238573543,0.0

"BUCKLE UP KIDS, WE&#39;RE ON AN EQUESTRIAN RANT! <br><br>1. MIND YOUR FUCKING MELON. We wear helmets for a goddamn reason, to protect our skull and our brain. I&#39;ve been riding 8 years I I wear mine every time I get on a horse. No matter what. I&#39;m honestly surprised that this dude wasn&#39;t thrown off. <br>2. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khPLWaBioOs&amp;t=1m47s"">1:47</a> WE DO NOT BOUNCE ON A HORSE&#39;S BACK. That was fucking disgusting to watch. My hand flew to my mouth. Ew. His reins being held at his fucking ear and him jumping around on the poor animal&#39;s back. You can see the white&#39;s of his eyes, which clearly shows he&#39;s terrified, agitated and uncomfortable. <br>3. HIS HEELS. I think I might vomit. We&#39;re not ballerina&#39;s. We have our TOES UP, HEELS DOWN. I was waiting for his foot to slip through the stirrup since he didn&#39;t have a heel on his shoe. Honestly I was waiting for the horse to get fed up with his shit and take off. <br>4. WE DON&#39;T GRAB A HANDFUL OF REIN AND GO. Thumb on top. Pinkie underneath, and the other three around the rein. Hands are kept low. <br>5. THIS HORSE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND AGITATED THIS WHOLE VIDEO! If I get people from the goddamn &#39;Logang&#39; saying otherwise, it&#39;s not hard to see. Looks at how the horse is carrying himself! Yes, Friesians (this breed of horse) carry themselves elegantly and with grace. They carry their heads high, but not tucked to their chest. <br>6. ANYTIME THE HORSE OPENS IT&#39;S MOUTH, IT&#39;S TO STOP THE PAIN. This idiot yanked on the reins for the whole goddamn video. The reins are connected to a metal bar in the horse&#39;s mouth called a bit. Bits are extremely invasive and abusive. No matter if you have &#39;Light hands&#39; or a &#39;Weak bit&#39;. ALL BITS ARE ABUSE. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khPLWaBioOs&amp;t=0m52s"">0:52</a> is a perfect example of this. <br><br>THIS RANT IS ALL I HAVE TIME FOR.

"The Panzerkampfwagen IV (Pz.Kpfw. IV), commonly known as the Panzer IV, was a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the Second World War. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 161.<br><br>The Panzer IV was the most numerous German tank and the second-most numerous German fully tracked armoured fighting vehicle of the Second World War; 8,553 Panzer IVs of all versions were built during World War II, only exceeded by the StuG III assault gun with 10,086 vehicles. Its chassis was also used as the base for many other fighting vehicles, including the Sturmgesch√ºtz IV assault gun, the Jagdpanzer IV self-propelled anti-tank gun, the Wirbelwind self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, and the Brummb√§r self-propelled gun.<br><br>The Panzer IV saw service in all combat theatres involving Germany and was the only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war. It was originally designed for infantry support, while the similar Panzer III was to fight armoured fighting vehicles. However, as the Germans faced the formidable T-34, the Panzer IV had more development potential, with a larger turret ring to mount more powerful guns, so it swapped roles with the Panzer III whose production wound down in 1943. The Panzer IV received various upgrades and design modifications, intended to counter new threats, extending its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the armour protection or upgrading the weapons, although during the last months of the war, with Germany&#39;s pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.<br><br>The Panzer IV was partially succeeded by the Panther medium tank, which was introduced to counter the Soviet T-34, although it continued to be a significant component of German armoured formations to the end of the war. It was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria. After the war, Syria procured Panzer IVs from France and Czechoslovakia, which saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War.&#39;",2.0,0.10653123,0.028942931,0.055218685,0.039947584,0.08310336605,0.0

"this song relates back to the middle passage of shipping slaves from different countries.<br>Middle Passage, the forced voyage of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the New World. It was one leg of the triangular trade route that took goods (such as knives, guns, ammunition, cotton cloth, tools, and brass dishes) from Europe to Africa, Africans to work as slaves in the Americas and West Indies, and items, mostly raw materials, produced on the plantations (sugar, rice, tobacco, indigo, rum, and cotton) back to Europe. From about 1518 to the mid-19th century, millions of African men, women, and children made the 21-to-90-day voyage aboard grossly overcrowded sailing ships manned by crews mostly from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal, and France.",0.0,0.15324512,0.06337463,0.12556632,0.023544617,0.1240266162,0.0

i&#39;m really happy they&#39;ve reconnected but we can&#39;t ignore the fact that this song was SO ICONIC. i actively identified as a member of the logang lol watched logan everyday while i was in college. this beef was actually the first time i ever heard of the paul brothers or the youtube world in general. i didn&#39;t know content creators were a thing. they were trending on twitter &amp; i was like &quot;who are the paul brothers&quot; &amp; that started a MASSIVE rabbit hole finding tons of creators &amp; finding out about things like vidcon &amp; creator summit etc. i remember being so fixated on logan cutting the video off &amp; talking about the second verse &amp; how he wasn&#39;t going to release it. then jake did something &amp; logan retaliated with the second verse. i still find logan&#39;s ig every now &amp; then to how he&#39;s doing &amp; what he&#39;s doing. it is so insane to look back at what a huge deal this whole thing was.,2.0,0.28857216,0.16751462,0.09328204,0.03235042,0.225262343,0.0

If I&#39;m being honest when Logan made that is tracked on JJ I kind of wanted the disstrack to go something like saying sensitive that only he told his friends then the Big Bang happens (*BOOM*) the rest of the sidemen come in and then just started to diss on JJ and then talking about like more sensitive stuff and then (*BOOM again) not only his ex-girlfriend but his recent girlfriend (if he had one at the time) and then the next scene is Logan with not only his ex but with his recent girlfriend on the bed with multiple empty used condoms.

"@skurbiester cuz that‚Äôs what he did, the only difference is that he had the script out of view. All he had to do was say sorry to everyone that was disturbed by the video, say sorry to the family of the victim and admit his wrong doing. He had to have a script for that?!?! It is not ok at all to have a script for an apology, dude they even confirmed this in the show called the office. If you watched it then you would probably remember when Dwight had to apologize to the office for staging a fire. He brought out a paper and said ‚ÄúI state my regret‚Äù another office worker asked him ‚ÄúYou needed a note to remember that?‚Äù Dwight then said that he didn‚Äôt remember it because he didn‚Äôt mean it. Btw the office is one of the most successful tv shows ever so I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of it. Those are professional, some of the best writers out there and they agree with me. It is not ok to have a script for an apology.

"@skurbiester like I said, an apology has to be authentic and heartfelt. You have to mean what you are saying. An interview does not have to be or need to be authentic or heartfelt. That‚Äôs the difference between the two. If you have a script then that means you do not care enough to remember. Although I suggest you to not have a script for an interview. Yes you can have one but the interviewer would have a better outlook on you if you didn‚Äôt have a script. If you have a script then that means you do not care enough to remember what you need to say. You absolutely cannot have a script for an apology.

Honestly he‚Äôs very authentic here and has shown a lot of growth over the years. As someone who spent years feeling suicidal I understand not everyone (including myself) always makes the best decisions. I think as long as he continues his path he‚Äôll actually help many others in life down the road and really will see this as an aha moment or epiphany to help guide him into being a better human being.

"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a Mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings. Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.",5.0,0.16765249,0.06582214,0.08666438,0.064645745,0.133978452,0.0

"Abacab is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Genesis, released on 18 September 1981 by Charisma Records. After their 1980 tour in support of their previous album, Duke (1980), the band took a break before they reconvened in 1981 to write and record a new album. Abacab is the first Genesis album recorded at The Farm, a recording studio bought by the group in Chiddingfold, Surrey. It marked the band&#39;s development from their progressive roots into more accessible and pop-oriented songs, and their conscious decision to write songs unlike their previous albums.",1.0,0.033806015,0.015720926,0.013948337,0.011379151,0.02686479745,0.0

@FREAKYSTONER32 Well no shit he&#39;s in it for the fame. It&#39;s his job. It&#39;s kind of like ridiculing someone for working a 9-5 because &quot;they do it for the money&quot;. That&#39;s one of the worst takes i&#39;ve ever heard. People like me just recognize that people can grow as individuals instead of &quot;people like you&quot; cancelling people over a tweet they made 10 years ago. I never made the argument that he was perfect by any means or even a good person. I said his personality is much better and the Logan Paul fans now are not the same Logan Paul fans from when this video came out.,1.0,0.6342749,0.4810288,0.20878418,0.036839653,0.5089953883,1.0

"In my opinion, the worst thing about these ‚Äúapology‚Äù videos is that they aren‚Äôt made because the person uploading them is truly sorry, they‚Äôre made because the uploader wants to stop getting backlash. And that‚Äôs a real problem. We can clearly see Logan isn‚Äôt really sorry from his facial expressions to how unenthusiastic he seems and it shows that he‚Äôs clearly reading from a script. Compare this to an actual apology video. PewDiePie‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Response‚Äù video. There‚Äôs no fake crying, he doesn‚Äôt try and make an excuse, he‚Äôs not reading from a script and you can clearly tell he meant every word of it. Logan here just got someone to write a script and probably did this in one take and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so bad. It‚Äôs not sincere.",0.0,0.3127066,0.089778624,0.06340405,0.012337137,0.2243002023,0.0

"This is truly astonishing. The amount of work, glory, AND detail that was put into this is absolutely amazing. It really goes to show everything; all the vibrant colors and feelings this video has to show the audience. It is indeed a work of art. And when the story finally climaxes, it does so in a way that lets you know something about the main character that nobody would have guessed, making this story extraordinarily unique and divine. Everything about you drinking dababy potion at 3am is changed in the perspective of the audience, and truly shocks and stuns us. This story is one of the most amazing, and the way it ends is truly fascinating as well. It almost makes you ache. You just want more from the story. It is very inspiring. This story makes you wonder if there are any other hidden secrets that the main character has the share.",2.0,0.11479026,0.032248367,0.018470341,0.016292779,0.08292723605,0.0

"@Samsung PRIME matured? How? Besides him being an annoying idiot, was, still is, and always will be. Besides that, he‚Äôs arrogantly picking fights with whomever he wants like he‚Äôs a professional boxer. ITS AN INSULT TO THE SPORT!! I don‚Äôt know much about that, but I heard he challenged mayweather, THE Floyd Mayweather!! He a star and a skilled professional that works day in and day out, his boxing is beautiful and almost seems like he dances when he fights, guiding his opponents to his own rhythm. He‚Äôs a professional boxer, and no two-bit half-assed YouTuber can challenge him and win JUST CUZ HE‚ÄôS TALLER!! I‚Äôm gonna love watching Floyd wipe the floor with that mf.
