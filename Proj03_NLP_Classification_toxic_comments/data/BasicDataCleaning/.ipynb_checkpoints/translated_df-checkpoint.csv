1673,"Say, &quot;O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah .&quot; But if they turn away, then say, &quot;Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].&quot;<br>(Quran 3:64)<br><br>Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them -  out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is swift in [taking] account.<br>(Quran 3:19)<br><br>And whoever desires other than Islam as religion -  never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.<br>(Quran 3:85)<br><br>They have certainly disbelieved who say, &quot; Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary&quot; while the Messiah has said, &quot;O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.&quot; Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.<br>(Quran 5:72)<br><br>They have certainly disbelieved who say that Allah is Christ, the son of Mary. Say, &quot;Then who could prevent Allah at all if He had intended to destroy Christ, the son of Mary, or his mother or everyone on the earth?&quot; And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates what He wills, and Allah is over all things competent.<br>(Quran 5:17)<br><br>But the Jews and the Christians say, &quot;We are the children of Allah and His beloved.&quot; Say, &quot;Then why does He punish you for your sins?&quot; Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the [final] destination.<br>(Quran 5:18)<br><br>The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.<br>(Quran 5:75)<br><br>They have certainly disbelieved who say, &quot; Allah is the third of three.&quot; And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.<br>(Quran 5:73).."

2162,"His way of earning money was by working as a clown at kids birthday parties. Despondency kicked in as he got bullied for his career, so he quit. Underneath the clown mask, was a middle aged man with mid-length hair and a beard. But what lied underneath that mask was more than just an age and hair; there was a shattered man, a man with a wanted place to go. His desired satisfaction of fitting in with the rest is eluded. Well, after quitting he was happy and became more happy, as the eyes formed more prominent and if you&#39;re wondering the true reason of why he quit, well, he got sucker-punched which lead to an ugly smile of no teeth, so, he went through surgery and was implanted with fake, real-looking, nice shiny-white teeth. He smiled even harder with new and increased confidence, which made his eyes squint and teeth lift. His attractive smile, enkindled infatuation. A girl was aroused and went to talk to him, he became nervous and produced sweat, you could see a large drop dancing down his forehead. Happed in a drowned catharsis, a innocent smile was situated on his face and basorexia transpired. He went in for the kiss and used tongue. They got married and lived happily ever after."
2163,all of this just to lose
2164,hate is mrbeast
2165,many years later we are back here xD

2167,This was 4 years ago time went fast
2168,@coreshot   i AM the one who knocks
2169,Does within reason count to unkindly poke fun at series and make fun of them in the opposite way than this and slap fun at em instead of a &quot;poke in the ribs&quot; cause corporate foreign channels can&#39;t beat another channel they foreign to him a corporation and PewDiePie is individual so it&#39;s not fair that T-Series has more subs LETS ALL RAID T-SERIES

2848,@Michael Prophet Muhammad  came to finish all the messages of the previous prophets (as you can see after Islam there weren&#39;t another big monotheistic religions). Here are some of his daily life teachings: 1-Always speak the truth <br>2-Wish the good for the others<br> 3-Be kind to every living being<br>4-Help and strengthen each other<br>5-Don&#39;t be unfair <br>6-Never criticise others<br>7-Always smile (to get good deeds in islam)
2849,"@Michael why you&#39;re saying &quot;your god&quot;? Allah is God and God is Allah, Allah is just an arabic translation of God. We have Satan too but in arabic is Shaitan (and we clearly hate him because he bring us to sin) so I don&#39;t think that we love him like you&#39;re saying."
2851,@Michael in Islam we love Jesus and Mary so much that in the qur&#39;an there is a verse who talk about of the life of Mary and the prophet Jesus (Sura Maryam). So don&#39;t think that we hate Jesus
2852,@Michael In Islam we love Jesus (Peace be upon him) but just as a prophet. The real king and lord of everything is God (translated in arabic اَلله‎)
2853,@Guy you found in the comment section pray to Jesus ask him to reveal himself to you and he will come to you and you will be amazed by his glory in the name of Jesus Christ.

3798,"Had to come back to this song after a beautiful memory resurfaced. For those who want a slightly funny story: friends had a little brother and he would NOT stop acting up. Kicked out of schools, suspended, didn’t stop thinking he was hard. No punishment worked. So, in order to break down the ego we gave him a haircut of random things we thought were funny. In big boldened letters, the back of his head shouted “Bitch Lasagna” at anybody who’d look. Stayed that way for months too. <br><br>TLDR; put bitch lasagna in a haircut cause a kid was acting up."

4311,no wonder all the people who his distracks pass him.i suggest you cheer for them then pew will get more subs.fawkkk
4312,"@237.z fair enough, if you do the math of pewds grow, with your country stuff, he will have 500 or 600 million"
4313,lets not forget that T-series consist of several people. PewDiePie is basically alone (except for his team) and also PewDiePie comes from a country with a population of 10 million. T-series is from a country with a population of more than 1 billion.
4315,That’s because pewdiepie retired from YouTube when he reached 100M subscribers and not he doesn’t try to actively grow as much as the pas
4317,The war that I don&#39;t regret witnessing
4318,I remember listening to this when I was 8<br>i never knew cussing was bad when I was 8 like bro what

7739,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh-RL__uN4&amp;t=0m15s"">0:15</a>"

7770,yuh
7772,i miss the old pewdiepie : (
7773,Sadness
7774,WHAT A FOOCKIN BANGER
7775,"<b>How much lasagna to feed all T-Series subscribers</b><br><br>It takes 25 square feet of wheat to make a day&#39;s worth of lasagna for 1 person. Assuming all 220 million of T-Series&#39; subs ate a day&#39;s worth of lasagna, It would take 5.5 Billion square feet of wheat to make all of the lasagna. It would take 200 square miles of wheat just to feed them the noodles in lasagna. Assuming we used pork (no beef for Indians), We would need about 1 pound of meat. We would need to raise about 800,000 pigs, which would take 45 square miles. Feeding the pigs would take almost 1500 square miles.<br>Now, assuming we made pure tomato sauce, we would need 2 cups of tomato sauce for each person, so 440 million cups of tomato sauce. You need 15 tomatoes for one cup, so 2 plants. We need 6.6 billion tomatoes, or 880 million tomato plants. This would take 550 square miles. <br><br>In total, you would need 2,245 square miles of land to feed all 220 million T-Series subscribers enough lasagna for 1 day."
7776,3 YEARS???

14771,"@777_DAI_777 How does it happen that the sound path does not coincide with the video? <BR> But very simple, do they have microphones in which you need to speak and the sound is written on them, I assume that it was a separate road (that is, not in the video itselfthere was a sound) and during installation, when they cut out some part of the picture, they forgot to cut the sound in the same places, or vice versa cut off too much <br> Perhaps it is generally yutub lags"
14773,The fact that he yells even with a mic

25642,Him being a merch whore is something people gotta appreciate? 😅
25644,"I like Logan more h than Jake. Because Logan has actually changed and when he said sorry he meant it bc he changed his mental health and became a better person. Also, Jake’s changed now but before he was an absoslutr asshole to his neighbors and didn’t give a shit if he was being loud."
25645,This song should be called maverick merch instead of Santa diss

25650,"@Joe Mama Hey buddy, that means I missed a letter not that I don&#39;t know how to spell. Anyways try again"
25651,@Victor Cruz Because I n#39;m a kid who searched for Christmas songs. You also spelled &quot;his &quot; wrong by the way. How ironic.
25652,@Joe Mama I said is fanbase USED to be kids. His vlogs are for mature audience now. And why are you here? Just asking.
25653,"@Victor Cruz Kids can spell and you sound pretty ignorant for saying that. I get that you&#39;re bored and all, I just don&#39;t see why you&#39;re watching it if you&#39;re not a part of that &quot;kid&quot; fanbase."
25654,@Joe Mama Would a kid know how to spell? Don&#39;t think so. And I&#39;m only here because youtube is really boring at the moment.
25655,"It&#39;s so fucking cringe, how can you like to this shit? Lmfao."

26990,"@Tiegan Barclay Yeah, I know what you you mean. But the Pauls would relentlessly plug their stuff on their own videos. Like One Direction would never promote their own products in their music videos and stuff."
26991,he’s making millions from being “lazy” and i’m not mad about it. good for him i wish i could and i bet most people would love to make millions for doing nothing and people shouldn’t be mad cause he gets to live everyone’s dream 🤷🏽‍♀️
26992,"i’m not a logan or jake paul fan but when you were a child was there not something you really liked and it had merch or something with that thing on it for example one direction, they literally just stuck their face on random products and i would want it all so badly 🤷🏽‍♀️"
26993,This is the prequel to Going broke. Guy can low-key spit
26994,Did Santa respond tho?

27227,I was about to say you&#39;re exaggerating but then he said &quot;I&#39;m the new Santa&quot; and I realized that the half of the song is him talking about his merch and the rest is him leading up to him flexing his merch
27228,Business savvy or what
27229,It&#39;s like 2020 but I still rap the whole song
27231,dude Santa has been really quiet since he wrote this song

29083,Like if Logan should make MAVERICK merch shoes
29088,No definetly NO I prefer the mature Logan someone who isn&#39;t cringe to watch and not too over the top I prefer a youtuber whos alot more chill but not too chill to the point where he&#39;s boring he still a decent fella but ain&#39;t annoying at the same time.

29946,is this already platinum or not cause if not then make it platinum!!
29951,OK Logan so no shame to you or anything but please take a couple riding lessons or at least a basic course in equine safety before you decided to look like you’re half falling off the saddle I am guys don’t hate on me I’ve been riding for a year I kind of know how to keep myself from getting hurt on a horse but Logan next time you do something the horse please take a couple equine safety classes.Also an English saddle you hold the reins with both hands not one hand like Western. Also whoever owns that horse you have done an amazing job making sure he won’t spill or won’t freak you on the reins  flopping around his neck good job because if I tried to do that I would probably get bucked off because I’m riding  a green horse oh joy
29954,The letter kills you

30223,"I was today years old to notice that he says something in a different language at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khPLWaBioOs&amp;t=1m38s"">1:38</a> 0-0"
30224,"BUCKLE UP KIDS, WE&#39;RE ON AN EQUESTRIAN RANT! <br><br>1. MIND YOUR FUCKING MELON. We wear helmets for a goddamn reason, to protect our skull and our brain. I&#39;ve been riding 8 years I I wear mine every time I get on a horse. No matter what. I&#39;m honestly surprised that this dude wasn&#39;t thrown off. <br>2. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khPLWaBioOs&amp;t=1m47s"">1:47</a> WE DO NOT BOUNCE ON A HORSE&#39;S BACK. That was fucking disgusting to watch. My hand flew to my mouth. Ew. His reins being held at his fucking ear and him jumping around on the poor animal&#39;s back. You can see the white&#39;s of his eyes, which clearly shows he&#39;s terrified, agitated and uncomfortable. <br>3. HIS HEELS. I think I might vomit. We&#39;re not ballerina&#39;s. We have our TOES UP, HEELS DOWN. I was waiting for his foot to slip through the stirrup since he didn&#39;t have a heel on his shoe. Honestly I was waiting for the horse to get fed up with his shit and take off. <br>4. WE DON&#39;T GRAB A HANDFUL OF REIN AND GO. Thumb on top. Pinkie underneath, and the other three around the rein. Hands are kept low. <br>5. THIS HORSE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND AGITATED THIS WHOLE VIDEO! If I get people from the goddamn &#39;Logang&#39; saying otherwise, it&#39;s not hard to see. Looks at how the horse is carrying himself! Yes, Friesians (this breed of horse) carry themselves elegantly and with grace. They carry their heads high, but not tucked to their chest. <br>6. ANYTIME THE HORSE OPENS IT&#39;S MOUTH, IT&#39;S TO STOP THE PAIN. This idiot yanked on the reins for the whole goddamn video. The reins are connected to a metal bar in the horse&#39;s mouth called a bit. Bits are extremely invasive and abusive. No matter if you have &#39;Light hands&#39; or a &#39;Weak bit&#39;. ALL BITS ARE ABUSE. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khPLWaBioOs&amp;t=0m52s"">0:52</a> is a perfect example of this. <br><br>THIS RANT IS ALL I HAVE TIME FOR. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID ABOUT THIS VIDEO, AND IF NOBODY ELSE WILL SAY IT - I WILL."

30479,So he fucked a lod lady that&#39;s fucked
30480,This is so stupid he is literally pulling the horses face off horses have feelings too and it’s abuse just because he doesn’t know how to ride doesn’t mean he can do that he should’ve got a horse instructor or special trainer because what he was doing is clearly hurting the horse and at one stage you could see the horse was getting ready to bolt just a message to all of you be careful on horsesAnd don’t hurt them you might be asking how do you know this I’ve been riding horses since I was 6 and I am now 11 I don’t think it’s fair to the horse the horse was obviously uncomfortable I hope he learns a lesson

36114,"The Panzerkampfwagen IV (Pz.Kpfw. IV), commonly known as the Panzer IV, was a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the Second World War. Its ordnance inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 161.<br><br>The Panzer IV was the most numerous German tank and the second-most numerous German fully tracked armoured fighting vehicle of the Second World War; 8,553 Panzer IVs of all versions were built during World War II, only exceeded by the StuG III assault gun with 10,086 vehicles. Its chassis was also used as the base for many other fighting vehicles, including the Sturmgeschütz IV assault gun, the Jagdpanzer IV self-propelled anti-tank gun, the Wirbelwind self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, and the Brummbär self-propelled gun.<br><br>The Panzer IV saw service in all combat theatres involving Germany and was the only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war. It was originally designed for infantry support, while the similar Panzer III was to fight armoured fighting vehicles. However, as the Germans faced the formidable T-34, the Panzer IV had more development potential, with a larger turret ring to mount more powerful guns, so it swapped roles with the Panzer III whose production wound down in 1943. The Panzer IV received various upgrades and design modifications, intended to counter new threats, extending its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the armour protection or upgrading the weapons, although during the last months of the war, with Germany&#39;s pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.<br><br>The Panzer IV was partially succeeded by the Panther medium tank, which was introduced to counter the Soviet T-34, although it continued to be a significant component of German armoured formations to the end of the war. It was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria. After the war, Syria procured Panzer IVs from France and Czechoslovakia, which saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War.&#39;"

38635,"this song relates back to the middle passage of shipping slaves from different countries.<br>Middle Passage, the forced voyage of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the New World. It was one leg of the triangular trade route that took goods (such as knives, guns, ammunition, cotton cloth, tools, and brass dishes) from Europe to Africa, Africans to work as slaves in the Americas and West Indies, and items, mostly raw materials, produced on the plantations (sugar, rice, tobacco, indigo, rum, and cotton) back to Europe. From about 1518 to the mid-19th century, millions of African men, women, and children made the 21-to-90-day voyage aboard grossly overcrowded sailing ships manned by crews mostly from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal, and France."

47504,2021 anyone?
47506,also shoutout rice gum holla at it!!1
47507,jake paul best paul brother !!!!!
47509,i&#39;m really happy they&#39;ve reconnected but we can&#39;t ignore the fact that this song was SO ICONIC. i actively identified as a member of the logang lol watched logan everyday while i was in college. this beef was actually the first time i ever heard of the paul brothers or the youtube world in general. i didn&#39;t know content creators were a thing. they were trending on twitter &amp; i was like &quot;who are the paul brothers&quot; &amp; that started a MASSIVE rabbit hole finding tons of creators &amp; finding out about things like vidcon &amp; creator summit etc. i remember being so fixated on logan cutting the video off &amp; talking about the second verse &amp; how he wasn&#39;t going to release it. then jake did something &amp; logan retaliated with the second verse. i still find logan&#39;s ig every now &amp; then to how he&#39;s doing &amp; what he&#39;s doing. it is so insane to look back at what a huge deal this whole thing was.
47511,HOW DO YOU HAVE MAZEBANK IRL
47512,Who&#39;s here in 2021
47514,Kids these days won’t know the hype around when Logan “destroyed” the second verse during his beef with Jake

48399,If I&#39;m being honest when Logan made that is tracked on JJ I kind of wanted the disstrack to go something like saying sensitive that only he told his friends then the Big Bang happens (*BOOM*) the rest of the sidemen come in and then just started to diss on JJ and then talking about like more sensitive stuff and then (*BOOM again) not only his ex-girlfriend but his recent girlfriend (if he had one at the time) and then the next scene is Logan with not only his ex but with his recent girlfriend on the bed with multiple empty used condoms. (so what do you guys think?)

48611,I&#39;m a six-year-old
48612,"ngl, i looked this up again"
48613,Am I the only one low key missing how Logan used to be. Like before all this shit happened to him and he had to change completely.-like I remember loving watching his old videos that he just had fun and nothing felt forced. (meaning when he was still back in his old apartment and he was starting up the maverick company- like the beginning days.)
48615,this crap still hits hella hard!!
48616,Watching this video after three years and knowing all the words but not thinking about it since three years ago it’s kinda insane
48617,@TheGlitterMinecart I&#39;m Homophobic

48639,"Remember how we all was waiting to see if Logan was going to drop the second part the this video and when he did, everybody went crazy and filmed reaction videos to see if it was Alyssa<br>Good times"
48640,"Tiktok drama and the YouTube drama that is going on now <br>Can never ever complete with the whole<br>Ricegum, Faze Banks, Alyssa Violet, Jake Paul, Logan Paul, Team 10 and if you were on Logan’s side or Jake Paul’s side with there distracks <br>2015-2017 was the elite years for YouTube and now what the hell is YouTube <br>We will never get this drama ever again<br>Miss it"

51302,That doesn’t make any sense bro
51303,"@Insas That phrase only makes sense when they do something in secret hoping that nobody will notice, but Logan literally made it the title of his video, and uploaded it on his main channel, he didn&#39;t get &#39;caught&#39;, he just didn&#39;t get the reaction that he expected to."
51304,"@yOu UnCuLtUrEd sWiNe made sense to 120+ ppl, ur clearly the odd one out😂educate urself a tiny bit"
51305,@Lebron James Harden I think he means the criticism he&#39;s been receiving for his behavior.

51700,my sister when she takes the meatgrinder and uses it on a rock
51701,People from iceland when the accidental bump into someone they know:
51704,where you mike wazowski hat
51705,He clearly had a severe and continuous lapse of his judgement
51706,Worst than boyfriend by justin bieber
51707,I think you meant insecure and pathetic
51708,2018: logan paul was a youtube meme<br><br><br><br>2022: andrew tate is a youtube meme
51709,He became better
51710,PLEASE WATCH THIS ON 2X SPEED
51711,This video is undoubtedly a YouTube classic.<br>For better or for worse
51712,"@skurbiester cuz that’s what he did, the only difference is that he had the script out of view. All he had to do was say sorry to everyone that was disturbed by the video, say sorry to the family of the victim and admit his wrong doing. He had to have a script for that?!?! It is not ok at all to have a script for an apology, dude they even confirmed this in the show called the office. If you watched it then you would probably remember when Dwight had to apologize to the office for staging a fire. He brought out a paper and said “I state my regret” another office worker asked him “You needed a note to remember that?” Dwight then said that he didn’t remember it because he didn’t mean it. Btw the office is one of the most successful tv shows ever so I’m sure you’ve heard of it. Those are professional, some of the best writers out there and they agree with me. It is not ok to have a script for an apology. Because it clearly means that you didn’t care for it because you didn’t remember it."
51713,"@skurbiester Dude your literally agreeing with me. He couldn’t remember what he had to say. THAT MEANS HE DIDNT CARE ENOUGH. You are clearly a Logan Pauler lmao. If he couldn’t remember what he had to say then that means he didn’t care enough. You are supposed to be real and heartfelt in an apology. He was not real at all, he had to read off of a god damn script cuz he couldn’t even fuckin remember what he was apologizing for and who he was apologizing to."
51714,​@Ironboss49 it&#39;s easy to say that from ur prespective but from his prespective with all the stress he don&#39;t wanna sigh or think alor about what is he gonna say (it&#39;s very important to think before u talk) it&#39;s not just a sorry buddy if he just said sorry people would say that&#39;s not a good enough of an apology it&#39;s simple really
51715,"@skurbiester like I said, an apology has to be authentic and heartfelt. You have to mean what you are saying. An interview does not have to be or need to be authentic or heartfelt. That’s the difference between the two. If you have a script then that means you do not care enough to remember. Although I suggest you to not have a script for an interview. Yes you can have one but the interviewer would have a better outlook on you if you didn’t have a script. If you have a script then that means you do not care enough to remember what you need to say. You absolutely cannot have a script for an apology. It MUST be authentic and heartfelt."
51716,​@Ironboss49 What do i look up? what is a script used for in an interview different than an apology?!
51718,"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgment, and I don't expect to be forgiven.I'm here simply to apologize.<br> What we found in the forest that day was obviously not planned.The reactions he saw in the cassette were raw;were not filtered.None of us knew how to react or how to feel.I should never have put the video.I should have landed the cameras and stopped recording what we were going through.<br> There are many things that I should have done differently, but I didn't do it.And so, from the bottom of my heart, regret.<br> I want to apologize to the internet.I want to apologize to anyone who saw the video.I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide.But even more important, I want to apologize to the victim and his family.<br> For my fans who are defending my actions, please do not.I do not deserve to be defended.My goal with my content is always to entertain;to widen the boundaries, to be all-inclusive.In the world where I live, I share almost everything I do.The intention is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious.<br> As I said, I made a huge mistake.I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm just here to apologize.<br> I'm ashamed of myself.I'm disappointed with myself.And I promise to be better.I will be better.Thanks."
51719,stupid
51720,Why he apologies it was a funny video love it
51721,Noob sauce
51722,Honestly he’s very authentic here and has shown a lot of growth over the years. As someone who spent years feeling suicidal I understand not everyone (including myself) always makes the best decisions. I think as long as he continues his path he’ll actually help many others in life down the road and really will see this as an aha moment or epiphany to help guide him into being a better human being. Keep on doing your best Logan 🫠
51723,When you fart accidentally at your parents!
51724,@Lovely💗 oh no
51725,Found it.
51726,You’re too innocent
51727,Forget about it bro
51728,You don’t want to know it’s fucked up
51729,"The difference between Logan Paul and the rest of the anonymous world that makes commentary is he&#39;s visible and they are not. His visibility provided an opportunity to display a heartless, disturbing action that required this apology. The anonymous world that judges him make heartless, disturbing actions daily and yet they don&#39;t feel required to own up to the responsibility to apologize for their actions. You think you are invisible but people see you and they still wait for your apology, too."
51731,Its been 4 years bruh get over it..he is a different man now..not saying what he did is ok but what do you expect him to do? Cry out rivers?
51732,No the fuck it’s not
51733,i’m going to say this whenever i need to perform something in front of my class
51734,From here on Logan’s reputation started going up
51735,I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t try and sell some apology merch at the end of the video.

51902,What did you FILM IT THEN IF YOU …. One second WHY
51903,Wait a min why do people think this is funny? Im not mad i just i need the context 😭

51906,"This was one of the most infamous videos of 2018, and it was only uploaded on the second day of the year!"
51907,Why am I here?

51919,@Blade Of Despair he doesn&#39;t seem to agree
51921,@Blade Of Despair to forget those things he did is the reason why he is still a thing on youtube
51924,bro says andrew Tate is corruption younger kids and I remember few years ago he was promoting this shit to his audience of kids and teens. Hypocrite. After this he &quot;changed&quot; no he just wanted to stay on youtube.
51926,i love how this became a meme tbh

I’m surrounded by good people and believe I make good decisions, but I’m still a human being.I can be wrong"

52146,@creature LMAO
52147,"Yes, he is discussing"
52148,"That&#39;s what I was saying like he didn&#39;t drag it on either. He could&#39;ve said something better and specific instead of the &quot;I&quot; statements he made, but it&#39;s not like he really acted a victim. He even told his fans to not justify him"
52149,OMFG I love fake apologies lolololololololololol. Rgb
52150,The face of the average American devoid of any manners.
52151,"“I have made a severe, and continuous, lapse in my judgement” that line should go down in YouTube history"
52154,"@John pork vr I guess you&#39;re right, but I mean it was 4 months ago which is basically considered ancient by internet standards. An apology would have been more effective closer to the event or even right after it."
52156,"@John pork vr And I&#39;ve slapped my brother across the face one time too. It happened 4 months ago, and Chris didn&#39;t sue so who cares."
52158,wheezing
52159,Damn Logan these rap lyrics are straight bars🔥🔥gonna make a rap song out this thing
52161,"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a Mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings. Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby."
52162,same
52167,@💎 DiamondNinjaX I did not say about my opinion plus why e arguing about a video that was posted 4 years ago so if u replied to me I will not answer

52201,"Some parts are memeable, but the apology rly wasn&#39;t bad at all"
52203,@Kotoamatsukami pretty sure theyre saying its so bad that anyone can look at it and say “yeah at least im not down there”
52204,"People can change but this isn’t a good role model to look for it, I hope that you find what you’re looking for but I don’t advise looking for it here.  Though I do think we can still continue to encourage people like Logan to change, but we also should hold them accountable for they’re actions."
52205,"He isn&#39;t as cringe anymore, but he is not a better person. Last summer he did a crypto scam. Extorting money out of his fans."
52206,He&#39;s lucky youtube got rid of the dislike button

52232,@AaronParayil that&#39;s too true. The internet is so ruthless and is full of ppl who think they know everything but they prolly no better irl
52233,"Bro it&#39;s happens in almost all channels. For example, pewdiepie gets hate in his old vids about t series and jacksepticeye gets horrible comments on his video about his father. It&#39;s just sad"

52301,First: Logan Paul <br>Second: Travis Scott <br>Third: Will Smith
52302,"I think it was wrong to post the video, but that the reaction was a normal psychological one and actually showed you cared more than anything. People in severely scary or traumatic situations laugh, it&#39;s a very normal reaction. Everyone is out here judging you but scientifically many of them would react the same exact way if they were there. I know this is old but I just wanted to make things straight. I was busy studying back when this happened but now I have the time to do a PSA and tell people to stop being so judgemental. You don&#39;t have to like him or not judge him for the video, but stop saying he doesn&#39;t care. I&#39;m sure it was equally traumatic for him and you don&#39;t know what he felt or went through for that video."

52359,"Abacab is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Genesis, released on 18 September 1981 by Charisma Records. After their 1980 tour in support of their previous album, Duke (1980), the band took a break before they reconvened in 1981 to write and record a new album. Abacab is the first Genesis album recorded at The Farm, a recording studio bought by the group in Chiddingfold, Surrey. It marked the band&#39;s development from their progressive roots into more accessible and pop-oriented songs, and their conscious decision to write songs unlike their previous albums."

52475,This is exactly what an apology vídeo should look like. From a technical standpoint it is awesome to see he doesn&#39;t try and repare his reputation right away. He acknowledges he is in the wrong and apologises as a step 0 of reparing reputation.
52476,@President Python it was funny 🤣
52479,Immatured logan
52480,@۰۪۫M۪۫۰۰۪۫I۪۫۰۰۪۫N۪۫۰ ۰۪۫F۪۫۰۰۪۫A۪۫۰۰۪۫E۪۫۰ yes
52481,he made fun of someone who (youtube bans the word so I have to say it wierdly) made themselves not exist anymore
52482,U dumb?
52484,Almost as bad as travis scott
52486,"And now thanks to new YouTube updates, with all the likes it has you&#39;d think it was extremely well received."

52490,lol i know this is a joke but its crazy this video has like 2.6 mil dislikes
52491,@maram ouerghi yes that was a joke do u know what sarcasm is
52492,@maram ouerghi I don&#39;t like when people support the wrong people and I rather support the right person like you then the wrong like other have been doing against you I also don&#39;t like when people speak for others like they know what they are thinking or stuff about them even if they do no one should have the rights to speak for others endless the person enjoys people talking for them which I don&#39;t think there&#39;s non or many
52493,@maram ouerghi yeah as if the dude was in this reply section the whole time.

52567,Travis Scott&#39;s apology makes this look like a masterpiece
52739,leaf
52741,He tried to scam people with his Dink Doink Crypto recently. He also tazed rats and uploaded that to YouTube months after this whole fiasco. He&#39;s still a piece of shit.
52744,You are a fool and a salacious
52750,It&#39;s Still Makes a Part of The YouTube History
52751,I hate Logan paul
52752,4 years later its fucking hilarious
52754,llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll;lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

52759,i got this recommended again after 4 years
52761,@bannamilk you know he advertised a crypto scam a few months ago right?
52764,Lol why tf did I just get this recommended to me
52767,Do u think Logan is better or worse now
52770,Who is watching this at 2022?
52771,Dislike
52772,@Kraken and the Rat Movies he advertised a crypto scam a couple of months ago
52773,@FREAKYSTONER32 ur just a fat ass loser who gets no bitches and can't accept the fact that people change
52774,@FREAKYSTONER32 Well no shit he&#39;s in it for the fame. It&#39;s his job. It&#39;s kind of like ridiculing someone for working a 9-5 because &quot;they do it for the money&quot;. That&#39;s one of the worst takes i&#39;ve ever heard. People like me just recognize that people can grow as individuals instead of &quot;people like you&quot; cancelling people over a tweet they made 10 years ago. I never made the argument that he was perfect by any means or even a good person. I said his personality is much better and the Logan Paul fans now are not the same Logan Paul fans from when this video came out.
52775,"@Kraken and the Rat Movies it&#39;s ridiculous that people like you can just forget all of his dumb shit. Yes people change, it does not make them a good person still. He&#39;s in it for the fame and nothing else"
52776,People can change. It happened years ago and if you&#39;ve heard about Logan recently his personality is certainly much better than it was at this point in time. He has a much older audience now as a result as well
52777,no one asked bozo
52779,"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer."

52944,"No. The whole thing was fake and pre-planned to get him on the news. They hired actors, lied about their location and more. Can&#39;t get much more scummy than that. Then recently, he became a Crypto scammer. He hasn&#39;t changed, he hasn&#39;t become a better person, he&#39;s still the rich, selfish cunt he always was."

53081,i dont forgive you baby. buy prime. film more
53082,autotune on this would be a banger
53084,You know it’s serious when a video ends with a period.
53085,why youtube recommending me this four years later
53086,Why am i getting recommended this
53087,KK Bestie
53088,Why is this trending in 2022?
53089,Why’s this being suggested to me rn 😂
53090,@Abd Elfattah Mamdoh oh got it now thanks for answering
53091,This is part of his vlog
53092,I remember he has a video with a body of a suicided man and people hated that
53093,be happy he at least felt sorry for what he did it be and if he just didn&#39;t care
53094,I can give you this ratio
53095,After posting that video he deep down knew he shouldn’t have done that..
53096,Accepted. Stay safe and don&#39;t do it again.
53097,Apologize to u mommothermommybirthgiverlifegiver
53098,Recommended moment
53099,Why did I laugh when he said &quot;I want to apologise to the internet&quot;
53100,ngl this feels racially motivated
53101,No need it was funny
53102,Why is this still up
53103,4 years later he’s still living up to his promise ❤️
53104,How do u have no likes lmao

53111,Holy fuck this was 4 hours ago
53112,"No way dude the vid Got 60 mil views, around 2 mil likes and no dislikes. You Got This King (satire)"
53113,"personally think it was a big turning point, everybody makes mistakes, logan is an example of people changing for the better after realising their mistake"
53114,More than 4 years and this false Lol Video still laughs
53115,Logan honestly wtf were you thinking at this point in time?
53116,Trash
53117,The way he tries to speak formally &quot;I&#39;ve made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement&quot; is so funny
53119,"Logan may be a shitty person, but at least he had the decency to keep this video up."
53120,"logan paul would’ve been much much worse if he didn’t do this. i really do believe this made him mature, not overshadowing the effort he had put into maturing. but at the end of the day i’m glad that this happened to him cuz he wouldn’t have been the logan paul we know now."
53121,Now this video has no dislikes.
53123,@Jasiyah Banks I said that 💀
53124,@Hoax I kinda said that..💀

53141,Felt like yesterday
53142,He changed so much inbetween 2018-2022
53143,i love you daddy
53144,People come from all over the world to hear your apologize.
53147,"I dunno, this feels like a pretty genuine apology compared to most others I&#39;ve seen"
53148,Youtube remove dislike is the worst thing yet🥲
53150,"No amount of growth forgives what you did. What you did is something that no person could ever achieve haphazardly or in ignorance. <br><br>What you did is irrevocably unforgivable. <br><br>You are unforgivable and I wish you would fade into obscurity because that’s what you’ve earned. <br><br>A life of being ignored and forgotten. Nothing more, nothing less."
53151,this source seems kinda eerie...
53152,Excuse me-!!!
53154,ve made a severe and continuous lapse of my judgment
53155,Your 4 years too late. Plus Hella people have already forgave him so idk why ur bitching for
53156,“I am sorry. Btw this video is sponsored by Raid shadow legends”
53157,4 years ago feels like yesterday
53158,Welcome to the future kids 😐
53159,This looks like a real apology compared to Travis Scott’s apology
53160,What did logan do?
53161,this is why youtube removed dislike counts
53163,Why am I seeing this in 2022
53164,"Country roads, take me home, to the plaaaace, I belooong, West Virginiaaaa!"
53165,"I kinda missed what was apparently a massive thing back then, can someone clue me in? Thank you."
53166,I cant believe he said “logang for life. The sponsor of this video is monster legends. An exclusive logang mythic monster is out from now to march 69. Finish the maze and you can claim him. thank you.”
53167,Who&#39;s here after prime
53168,I just don’t have time some people think that talk harsh words to person with down syndrome I don’t like people like that
53170,Honestly watching this and looking at Logan now is like a whole new man what he did was terrible but I will not lie he finally learned to grow up and mature from it.
53174,Smash that like button and check out my limited edition merch! And again so sorry
53175,nah its just stupid
53176,what did he do?

53198,Can’t believe it’s beeen 4 years
53201,"Im sorry, <b>but</b> first, this video is sponsored by RAID SHADOW LEGENDS!"
53208,actually there are 2.6M dislikes
53213,Bro you can see that he is reading a script
53215,It was probably the most inhumane thing I’ve ever seen in my life
53219,I’ve made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement.
53220,"Where can I find that Hat, Amazon link anyone?"
53223,@Hayloft not saying anything about the AstroFest situation. I’m saying that they both made really shitty apologies.

53487,Tbh compared to Travis Scott&#39;s apology this is oscar worthy
53488,I actually like the first thing he says. It’s relatable. But he’s still a pos
53489,This genuinely feels like he&#39;s being held at gunpoint and he&#39;s running on a script someone told him to say.
53490,I remember this oh my gosh
53491,Lol mike wazowski
53492,i can not

53607,Without the dislike this video looks like it was well received by the community
53608,2.6m now
53609,Sadly we won’t be able to see how many dislikes this video has due to YouTube removing the dislike button counter.
53610,Use me as the dislike button
53611,It takes a much worse controversy for people to warm up to an apology like this one. All the time.
53612,man so happy i can still see the dislikes
53613,"Wow, 1.7M likes, this apology video must be great!"
53614,"In my opinion, the worst thing about these “apology” videos is that they aren’t made because the person uploading them is truly sorry, they’re made because the uploader wants to stop getting backlash. And that’s a real problem. We can clearly see Logan isn’t really sorry from his facial expressions to how unenthusiastic he seems and it shows that he’s clearly reading from a script. Compare this to an actual apology video. PewDiePie’s “My Response” video. There’s no fake crying, he doesn’t try and make an excuse, he’s not reading from a script and you can clearly tell he meant every word of it. Logan here just got someone to write a script and probably did this in one take and that’s why it’s so bad. It’s not sincere."
53615,1.7 million likes? surely this means the apology is great!
53616,"Youboob removed dislikes, so here is a comment to replace the dislike button"
53617,What the... He has 2 million dislike :(<br>I want to know that he can apology about what happened here.
53618,Wow 2.5M's praise
53619,I feel like his apology was sincere and we should try to move past it. I also give my condolences to the victim&#39;s family.
53620,I hate you
53621,&quot; <b>OMG 1.7M likes everybody must&#39;ve forgiven him</b> &quot;
53622,They f***ing removed the dislike button!!

Ironically, most people don’t even apologize in their “apologies”. In fact Logan might actually have one of the best apologies out there"

54097,There is no saying sorry man. That video was to bad
54098,You are absolutely disgusting
54099,why yall disliking man

54109,ayo why you still commenting on this like it happened yesterday bruhhh
54110,"Yah ok,you laughed Logan,that right there almost made me wanna puke,how dare you"
54111,Idk why i&#39;m watching this again lol
54112,"People are going “this is a super vague apology”, but I have to disagree with them, Logan Paul is very serious about this, he really is sorry, and I’m disappointed that the other people are diminishing his attempts to recover from the hate, he never intended it to be offensive to people, he <b>is</b> sorry, please stop doing this to him, I hope you understand"
54114,@JuzNick that is true. It never made it ok. He knew and had accepted the fact that it wasn’t ok and that he messed up big time. He was full aware that he had gone from the most liked and successful YouTuber to the most hated overnight in a split second. But I do agree. That was the most wrong thing known to human nature
54115,"@Tina Pourshirazi I&#39;m glad he saved your life but that doesn&#39;t make what he did okay at all, I wouldn&#39;t care if he apologized a million times, it still wasn&#39;t responsible, he had to even edit all of the footage that was there, when he was going through that footage it should&#39;ve clicked that he needed to blur someone&#39;s body. Especially a deceased person&#39;s body."

54695,the dislikes though
54696,"funny how people still comment on this video, and those comments still get thousands of likes."

54771,@Crystal Wu cap it ain’t cost him shit but more fame and a lot of ppl mad
54772,@H22DBoyDre no the apology was all right as an apology itself. It’s the fact that he even decided to film the video in the first place. And you might say “it’s okay to make mistakes” but this isn’t just a whoopsy-doodle-my-bad-lololol. This is a big mistake that nearly cost him his career.
54773,They felt like he was faking it
54774,"3 years later, I can confirm he is better"

54881,Don't come to Japan for the rest of your life.
54882,I think the apology was ok but I still won’t forgive him
54883,"He acted pretty mature for this, like todays drama they would go on twitter and post screenshots with their stans acting as guard dogs. This is one of the better apologies"
54884,&quot;When you made the baby cry&quot;
54886,i know its a long time ago but i still frown upon your existence
54887,You like I like<br><br>You dislike I dislike
54888,Is anyone else here for no reason
54891,When you drop a bunch of books in school:
54892,"Who tf gives a shit about you people? He has no time to read the comments being like “Logan, I frown upon your existence.” He actually felt bad man. Get over it, or take off."
54894,Because you used to have a brain like “Oh he felt bad. That’s respectful. Not his fault the other idiot made him laugh.”
54895,If

54916,"he came a long way since this video, I just started watching him and his vlogs of 19 and 20 are just pure content and nothing bullshit like he did before massive respect for Logan.<br>He did better believe it or not."
54917,RATIO
54919,When you &#39;re explaining to your Indian parents that you &#39;re sorry that you ever thought about not becoming a doctor:
54920,I searched for this... just to read the comments.
54921,"@Statik Which I just did, joking about you copying the top comment. It’s called comedy, buddy."
54922,@Zyfated its called comedy
54923,"When you try to copy the top comments, but fail horribly"
54925,Oh ok
54926,"Why is there only Japanese subtitles?Something has been backfired anymore, right?w"
54928,Logan is so much better now
54932,Its ok man
54935,"@DorioRioi Tsu <br> You don't do bad things, so apologize."
54936,"I'm ° ° Sushi -sin & QUOT;<br> I will go to Nihongo & QUOT;What I did is shaken to me.<br> I'm sorry, for bad behavior of others: ("
54938,"@Zyfated my man, protesting and giving one homeless man money doesn’t cancel out that he scammed his audience 🤨, if you’re older than 15 that’s pretty embarrassing. It ain’t just Pokémon either, he’s also got a crypto scam in the works. It’s pretty obvious dude"
54944,I wish I could be caught in a yakuza and sank into the sea
54946,This video got the most views on this channel haha

55114,When you hit your sibling and don’t want them to start screaming:
55115,Somewhere in the future: “GOING TO LOGAN PAUL’S GRAVE AT 3:00 AM”
55117,"This is truly astonishing. The amount of work, glory, AND detail that was put into this is absolutely amazing. It really goes to show everything; all the vibrant colors and feelings this video has to show the audience. It is indeed a work of art. And when the story finally climaxes, it does so in a way that lets you know something about the main character that nobody would have guessed, making this story extraordinarily unique and divine. Everything about you drinking dababy potion at 3am is changed in the perspective of the audience, and truly shocks and stuns us. This story is one of the most amazing, and the way it ends is truly fascinating as well. It almost makes you ache. You just want more from the story. It is very inspiring. This story makes you wonder if there are any other hidden secrets that the main character has the share."
55118,It’s so disingenuous/scripted
55119,The fact that theres more dislikes than likes turned me into a tea kettle
55121,devin trying to convince trevor to let him go:

55431,He prolly rubbed his eyes really hard for it to be red and oh eye drops
55432,At least he didn&#39;t make it like a 20 minute video with advertisements and everything.
55433,Mistakes are done unintentionally. But still I think we can 10% accept this apology. But whatever.
55434,I think its pretty high in the worst apologies ever. he starts off by saying his content is genuine and their reactions were real.
55435,"Syuke I mean, it was and is still an incredibly shitty horrible thing to do though."

55784,Amir Abou ismail not telling you
55785,@Haha How funny dont be an imbecile he's clearly matured. If you &#39;re still mad about the event that happened 3 years ago then thats your problem mate
55786,"@Samsung PRIME matured? How? Besides him being an annoying idiot, was, still is, and always will be. Besides that, he’s arrogantly picking fights with whomever he wants like he’s a professional boxer. ITS AN INSULT TO THE SPORT!! I don’t know much about that, but I heard he challenged mayweather, THE Floyd Mayweather!! He a star and a skilled professional that works day in and day out, his boxing is beautiful and almost seems like he dances when he fights, guiding his opponents to his own rhythm. He’s a professional boxer, and no two-bit half-assed YouTuber can challenge him and win JUST CUZ HE’S TALLER!! I’m gonna love watching Floyd wipe the floor with that mf. So much for “maturity” with that arrogance and overconfidence. He has no passion for martial arts or boxing, and I’m gonna love it when a fame whore like him gets wats coming to him"
55787,he&#39;s matured a lot now if your mad then stay mad it won&#39;t get you anywhere.
55788,Cope
55789,Idk about that.
55790,He promised to be better. Not disappointed.

55800,"@Jay Plays Every apology is an act on youtube, at least this was a decent act."
55801,If it&#39;s an act then it&#39;s not an &quot;apology&quot;
55802,Nigga this was 3 years ago
55803,When you ask for a new console and your mom brings up the fact that yesterday you didn’t finish your food.
55804,When the teacher tells you to say sorry to another child
55806,"First of all, do you have no Japanese in YouTube's subtitles, and there is no will to apologize to Japan?"

He did an interview where he thought that it was not right for YouTube to drop him from the preferred program. On its own, no it&#39;s not a bad apology, but he seems so fake in it. He seems like he did when he was acting in movies and TV, which was just really badly."

56514,"I continuously expired my judgment, but I don't expect it to be allowed.I'm just here to apologize.It was obviously out of plan that I came across that day.The reaction I saw on the tape was raw.They were not filtered.Nobody at us did not know how to react or how they felt.I shouldn't have posted a video.I should have dropped the camera and stopped the record of what we experienced.There were many things I had to do in another way, but I didn't.And for that, we sincerely apologize.I want to apologize to the Internet.We apologize to those who have watched the video.We apologize to those who are affected or touched by bad things.But the most important thing is to apologize to the victims and their families.Don't do it for my fans who defend my actions.I am not worth being defended.My content goals are always entertained.Push the limit and be comprehensive.In the world where I live, I share almost everything I do.Its intentions must not be emotional, cruel, or malicious.As I said, I made a big mistake.I don't expect to be allowed, I'm just here to apologize.I am ashamed of myself.I am disappointed with myself.And I promise to be better.I get better.thank you very much."

His Maverick clothing line made $1m a day for 3 days during the holidays in 2019. Plus he has the Maverick Club membership club. He&#39;s actually savvy to build income streams away from YouTube.
57288,"Sadly Youtube sees his subscription numbers and get&#39;s 40% of his income through clicks, views and likes.<br>They will never shutdown any channel that has more than 22 million subs.<br><br>It&#39;s about money and always will be.<br>Logan Paul is a sociopath with absolutely no empathy for human beings.

57322,@H8ow Roblox it may have been a few years ago but he is still a terrible person for what he did and he should not be allowed to still be making videos. this apology is empty and was only meant so people will forgive him and he will get more money.

57470,"@X well considering what he did, i think he needs to make it more than 1 hour, what he did was unacceptable n i think you know that"

57720,I&#39;m sorry Logan but this is unforgivable.
57721,"You&#39;re still a dick surprisingly, the video changed nothing. We over here at the ussr dis-approve of this bullshit."

57736,@Baguette He <br>is not actually sorry
57747,"To make me sway, I&#39;m angry that you offered a body."

57763,"@pessimist over 20 million people, and he is way more than just a talentless goober. u must be stupid, or just a diehard hater"
57764,@Abhiram i have a question. who the fuck is over 9 and watches this talentless goober
57765,@pessimist  only 40 percent of his viewers were below 25. thats pretty good considering most youtube viewers are between 15-35
57766,@pessimist his average viewer age is well over 18 in case u didnt know
57767,We cant forgive him because his mother&#39;s name isn&#39;t Martha.
57768,How parents expect you to apologize to your siblings

57772,Lol it’s fake af what you mean? Here’s his four step process of making this video <br><br>Pour water on face <br>Make someone do a  script <br>Pretend to know what was wrong while only making this video cause of backlash<br>Read script
57773,He has made a severe continuous lapse of his judgement.
57774,"I’m going tbh as much as I hate what he did this was one of the more genuine apologies. Or he could be a really good actor idk. People might bring up the fact that he back tracked on social media before this however I thinking about the psychology that goes into it, his ego probably showed up as the brains defense mechanism when confronted by guilt. Don’t take the idea of ego sometimes being a defense mechanism from me take it from a psychologist I heard of."

58868,"He chose to upload the video, he laughed at the body. This wasn&#39;t a mistake"
58870,Who bets that Logan Paul is proud that this apology video is the most viewed apology video
58872,Subtitles: <b>I serve Russia</b>
58873,Logan brings up an important question: who or what is the internet?
58874,Except for Logan of cause ♥️

58877,That fact is your now saying this smh
58878,"Ok chill jesus, this was 2 years ago"
58880,I come here from every apology video and it saddens me that LOGAN PAUL Ia ABLe to understand what a apology is and is able to show emotion more than other yotubers like I just came from mini lads and it disgusts me that even Logan Paul has the foresight to realize he fucked up
58881,When logan lost a fight
58882,The best of my best

60228,"I was a fan of him before this happened. after it happened i hated him. It took me to see him grow and move forward to forgive him. But I think everyone on this planet can agree that he is a much better, smarter, more evolved, man now. Kudos to this man for taking an L, coming back from it, and not quitting. through his entire journey he never gave up once. I am very proud of how far he has gone since the day this video was put out."

His new content is actually watchable for people over the age of 10 and he seems to have gotten his shit together. Jake on the other hand...<br>Also not turning the comments off and crying like every other YouTuber. I hate it when they bawl their eyes out for sympathy."

Not only that but you WALK UP TO him and close in on him and snicker with your friends. The amount of disrespect is just unimaginable. This is disgusting and for this kind of inhumane behaviour, you made a 1 minute and 44 second video claiming forgiveness from your &#39;apology&#39;. The amount of rudeness and lack of respect is just unbearable. Absolutely vile."
