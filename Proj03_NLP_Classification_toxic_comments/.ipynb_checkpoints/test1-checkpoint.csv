"China has cameras everywhere, a full-fledged cell phone tracking system, and people are monitored by a government surveillance system.  <br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br>In China if you want to track a specific person, you can.  When someone goes missing, the relevant information can be hidden by the Chinese Communist government so that the person cannot be found.<br>In recent years, many underage students have gone missing.  It is rarely reported in official Chinese media.  In November 2022, the disappearance of a young boy in Wuhan caused great concern among Chinese people.<br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br>In the West, waiting for a suitable organ takes a long time.  However, many Chinese transplant hospitals only take a week to a month to complete a match and find a suitable donor for a patient.  Some even offer emergency transplants, in stark contrast to the long waiting times for donors in other countries.  Some organ transplant operations in China have multiple matching organs on standby for each patient.<br>Few Chinese voluntarily donate organs because the traditional Chinese culture highly values ​​the integrity of the physical body.  China has a long-standing culture of believing that the body is a gift from parents and heaven, and that the soul needs to be cared for and protected so it can be taken to the next reincarnation.  Moreover, in recent decades, the Chinese government has not made a big call for organ donation.  However, there are many organs available.  Organ crimes in China were first exposed by overseas Falun Gong practitioners.  Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents, many of whom were detained in prisons and detention centers, had their blood drawn under the guise of health checks. They soon disappeared.  Sources within the CCP system have revealed that many of the organ transplant donors come from these Falun Gong practitioners.  Behind this is the organ transplant industry chain; the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s police, prosecutors, courts, hospitals, and the Triad of Chinese criminal gangs. <br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br>Such practices have continued for more than 20 years since former party leader Jiang Zemin&#39;s crackdown on Falun Gong in 1999.  The organ transplant industry chain has also spread to Southeast Asian countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.  The Chinese government-led organ transplant industry will use the big data widely collected and generated during the past three years of the Covid pandemic to quickly identify specific organs and make more accurate matches.  Matches to transplant recipients can be easily found from vast amounts of genetic data.  Those identified have gone missing. There has been an increase in the number of teenagers who have disappeared.<br>Evidence has been found to suggest that Falun Gong detainees were mass murdered for their organs. Massive disappearances of young Uyghur men, reports of routine blood tests of Uyghur political prisoners, reports of mysterious deaths of Tibetans and Uyghurs in custody — all of these people are under the control of the Chinese Communist government, are victims of systematic organ harvesting. It’s a crime of the Chinese government, a genocide committed by the Chinese government. Japanese people are also being targeted.<br><br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br><br>The world will decouple from China and Russia.<br><br>The world will put the most severe economic sanctions on China as we do on Russia. <br><br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇺🇸🇬🇧🇨🇦🇪🇺🇯🇵<br><br><br>Chinese students who<br>receive Chinese government’s scholarship must sign agreements with the Chinese government.  In Written contracts, these students must promise that ①they won’t engage in activities that harm the interests of Chinese government and that ②they must follow the management of Chinese consulates. <br>🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵<br><br>Several Chinese Students at Lund University in Sweden were found out to have signed these agreements. <br>The agreements are between students and the China Scholarship Council or CSC. The agency is under China&#39;s Ministy of Education. CSC sends Chinese students to study on scholarships around the world including the United States. The CSC works with many colleges in the U.S. like Harvard, MIT, and UCLA. About 370,000 Chinese students in the U.S. on 2020.

In China if you want to track a specific person, you can.  When someone goes missing, the relevant information can be hidden by the Chinese Communist government so that the person cannot be found.
In recent years, many underage students have gone missing.  It is rarely reported in official Chinese media.  In November 2022, the disappearance of a young boy in Wuhan caused great concern among Chinese people.

In the West, waiting for a suitable organ takes a long time.  However, many Chinese transplant hospitals only take a week to a month to complete a match and find a suitable donor for a patient.  Some even offer emergency transplants, in stark contrast to the long waiting times for donors in other countries.  Some organ transplant operations in China have multiple matching organs on standby for each patient.
Few Chinese voluntarily donate organs because the traditional Chinese culture highly values ​​the integrity of the physical body.  China has a long-standing culture of believing that the body is a gift from parents and heaven, and that the soul needs to be cared for and protected so it can be taken to the next reincarnation.  Moreover, in recent decades, the Chinese government has not made a big call for organ donation.  However, there are many organs available.  Organ crimes in China were first exposed by overseas Falun Gong practitioners.  Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents, many of whom were detained in prisons and detention centers, had their blood drawn under the guise of health checks. They soon disappeared.  Sources within the CCP system have revealed that many of the organ transplant donors come from these Falun Gong practitioners.  Behind this is the organ transplant industry chain; the Chinese Communist Party's police, prosecutors, courts, hospitals, and the Triad of Chinese criminal gangs. 
🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵
Such practices have continued for more than 20 years since former party leader Jiang Zemin's crackdown on Falun Gong in 1999.  The organ transplant industry chain has also spread to Southeast Asian countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.  The Chinese government-led organ transplant industry will use the big data widely collected and generated during the past three years of the Covid pandemic to quickly identify specific organs and make more accurate matches.  Matches to transplant recipients can be easily found from vast amounts of genetic data.  Those identified have gone missing. There has been an increase in the number of teenagers who have disappeared.
Evidence has been found to suggest that Falun Gong detainees were mass murdered for their organs. Massive disappearances of young Uyghur men, reports of routine blood tests of Uyghur political prisoners, reports of mysterious deaths of Tibetans and Uyghurs in custody — all of these people are under the control of the Chinese Communist government, are victims of systematic organ harvesting. It’s a crime of the Chinese government, a genocide committed by the Chinese government. Japanese people are also being targeted.

Chinese students who
receive Chinese government’s scholarship must sign agreements with the Chinese government.  In Written contracts, these students must promise that ①they won’t engage in activities that harm the interests of Chinese government and that ②they must follow the management of Chinese consulates. 
🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵

Several Chinese Students at Lund University in Sweden were found out to have signed these agreements. 
The agreements are between students and the China Scholarship Council or CSC. The agency is under China's Ministy of Education. CSC sends Chinese students to study on scholarships around the world including the United States. The CSC works with many colleges in the U.S. like Harvard, MIT, and UCLA. About 370,000 Chinese students in the U.S. on 2020. One in every 14 Chinese students in America
are sponsored by CSC. 

The students must swear loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. 
""Applicants must support the leadership of the Communist Party and the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.”
CSC asks students to submit periodic research reports to Chinese consulates. 
The students are being forced to follow the Chinese Communist party's orders, like participating in the Chinese Government’s overseas influence operations, gathering intelligence and stealing intellectual properties. The Chinese Government is exploiting students to steal intellectual property from the West.
A guarantor of a student has to sign the agreement as well. Under the contract, that guarantor can’t leave China for over three months when  the student is studying abroad, and the guarantor needs to pay scholarship payment if the student brakes the signed agreements. 
Two universities in Sweden have stopped working with CSC.

The ""tone"" of the Chinese operative's comments, the tone of the language, is devised to create the perception that the comments are the opinions of the average Japanese.

Some of the Chinese government-led propaganda posts target not only Japanese but also Chinese residents in Japan.  Chinese government-led propaganda is critical of democracy and supportive of anti-democrats.

Even as Twitter has embarked on a mass deletion of accounts, Chinese operatives have been filling the void within days by launching new accounts or reusing existing ones.

Comments by Chinese operatives to discourage Hong Kong citizens seeking U.S. help in democratization: ``Abandon unrealistic illusions immediately and cut ties with the U.S. side'', ``Think twice before making mistakes'' .

Chinese government-led operatives continue to spread geopolitical narratives favorable to the Chinese Communist Party and comment propaganda about Hong Kong politicians.  Similarly, Chinese agents are targeting governments and politicians in Taiwan, the United States, and Japan.

 🇯🇵🇺🇦🇹🇼🇱🇹🇨🇦🇺🇸🇯🇵

One of the accounts of a Chinese agent who posts pro-Russian comments registered in June 2020, changed its account name 549 times, changed the location 69 times, and posted 5,652 comments in less than a year.  It had 165,765 likes made by itself.

The Chinese operative pretends to be Japanese and also makes comments about ``the operative''.

Chinese operatives try to spread propaganda by using enemy’s key figures and specific cases with lies.

Chinese operatives try to influence public opinion by lying to Japanese people (propaganda) since peacetime.

Chinese agents try to gauge the intentions of the Japanese, lure them off guard, and discourage them from fighting evil.

Chinese operatives try to gain the initiative by claiming the opposite false ""facts"" to the enemy's (Japanese) comments, denying and counterattacking.

Chinese operatives try to explain the rationality and legality of their country's actions with lies, and try to condescend on a humanitarian basis.

Chinese operatives spread propaganda by telling false battlefield environmental information.

Chinese operatives use the psychological characteristics and weaknesses of their enemies (Ukraine, US, and Japan) to promote division and chaos.

Chinese operatives change account names and impersonate other people to post, trying to strengthen the psychological defense line of allies.

Chinese operatives show off the military power (nuclear weapons) of them and their allies and shallowly try to intimidate and scare the enemy.  Just like the Russian government.

Chinese operatives develop propaganda against the enemy (Japanese) not only in wartime but also in peacetime through military-civil union (integration of military and civilian resources).

Chinese operatives try to propagate the false ""military predicament"" of the enemy (Ukraine, US, Japan).

Chinese operatives seek to spread propaganda of limited ""political dominance"" of them and their allies ""other than human rights issues.""

This is your question?
Hahahahaha
What is occupation? What is sovereignty? Are you trying to play with words?
You'd better go and learn from the UN's explanation of the ownership of the island.
Still need me to explain to you?
You don't even know how the Philippines was occupied, so you discuss it with me?
You don't even know the history of this island and you have the courage to ask questions?
in american terms
God, am I talking about belonging with an ignorant person?
Is that what you say?
Do I sound like an American?
If you want to discuss, you can first search the history to find out,
By the way, put away your childish word games.
ok?
Considering how ignorant you are.
Let me spread some kindness to you.
The islands of the United Nations are changed for 50 years when they are occupied, and the ownership will be given to those who occupy the islands.
Philippine occupation for 15 years.
And before that, because of the typhoon, we were forced to leave the island.
So you think this island should belong to the Filipinos?
As for the judgment of the International Tribunal for the Sea.
The Tribunal of the Sea is not an organization under the United Nations. It rents a building with the United Nations, so everyone thinks that the International Tribunal of the Sea is affiliated with the United Nations.
Its previous judgments were all about international private trade.
Do you understand now?
As I said, if you don't like China, you can criticize it, but you have to speak with the facts, this is an independent personality and thought.
If you judge affiliation based on ideology.
There is no need to discuss it with me.

"@John 5864 While it&#39;s true that the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) established under UNCLOS has limited jurisdiction over disputes between states, particularly those relating to maritime boundaries and the exploitation of maritime resources, it&#39;s important to note that the tribunal did have jurisdiction over the Philippines v. China case. In this case, the tribunal&#39;s decision focused on China&#39;s maritime claims and activities in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, which the Philippines argued were in violation of UNCLOS. While the issue of territorial sovereignty over the disputed islands was not directly addressed, the tribunal did find that China&#39;s claims to historic rights over the waters within the &quot;nine-dash line&quot; were incompatible with UNCLOS. The tribunal&#39;s decision was binding on the parties to the dispute under UNCLOS. While the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has jurisdiction over disputes between states related to issues such as territorial sovereignty, the Philippines chose to pursue its case through UNCLOS dispute resolution mechanisms, which was a legitimate choice under international law.

outbreak (noun) · outbreaks (plural noun)
a SUDDEN occurrence of something unwelcome, such as war or disease:

sudden (adjective)
occurring or done quickly and UNEXPECTEDLY or without warning:

surprise
an UNEXPECTED or astonishing event, fact, etc.:

► Therefore, a SURPRISE OUTBREAK = an UNEXPECTED, UNEXPECTED DISEASE or war ◄

Do you respect the history of other countries?
The U.S. policy towards the South China Sea after World War II is China’s. Are you denying it now?
Just because of ideology?
Why is there still a border conflict between China and India?
China gave Vietnam a section of the U-shaped line in the South China Sea,
If the U-shaped line does not belong to China in your perception, then the section given to Vietnam does not belong to Vietnam either.
Why is China still in conflict with the Philippines?
China is a big country, it won the United Nations army in the Korean War, and with its current military strength, do you think China can’t take over the islands?
If you think the Philippine military is weak, what about the Sino-Indian border?
China defeated India in the 1960s, why are there still border conflicts now?
Have you understood?
China's all foreign countries are based on peace, the Taiwan issue, the Japanese issue, the South China Sea issue, and the Philippine issue. Why does one country always appear?
China can propose the law of the South China Sea and develop peacefully. Who will stand in the way?
Now start talking about other people's problems?

"In recent years, the Philippines has shifted its foreign policy stance by distancing itself from the United States and seeking closer ties with China. The hope was that China would address its encroachment and aggressive actions towards the Philippines, including targeting Filipino coast guards with military-grade lasers that cause temporary blindness. However, despite efforts to build friendly relations, China&#39;s aggression has continued. Even after a visit by the Philippine President to China, another aggressive move from China occurred shortly after. While China may talk about peace, stability, and friendship, its actions have contradicted its words, with a pattern of lies, hypocrisy, and inconsistency in its behavior. And this realization has led the Philippines to understand that maintaining strong ties with a trusted, long-time friend nation is preferable to trying to please a deceitful neighbor.","In recent years, the Philippines has shifted its foreign policy stance by distancing itself from the United States and seeking closer ties with China.

The United States and its Allies, the United Nations, the World need to help Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Hui Ningxia, Hong Kong, ... become independent countries from the CCP zombie invasion. The CCP zombies seriously threaten to invade and expand the East Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan, India, etc. The CCP has invaded 200 nautical miles of many countries to exploit seafood. The CCP supports Pakistan against India, supports Iran, North Korea, ... against the US and its allies. The CCP threatens to expand the 'global supply chain' and expand the Army to invade, threatens to 'expand the debt trap with many countries' by 'lending to invade'. The CCP brutally represses, detains and kills people in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia... Over the past 30 years, the CCP has stolen technology, copyright, intelligence and information confidential information of the US and EU through Huawei, ZTE, ... from international students and Chinese living abroad. The CCP 'drinks all the water of the Mekong River in the dry season and releases the water causing flooding downstream in the rainy season'. The CCP has invaded and seriously threatened the 'border invasion' of 13 neighboring countries. The CCP invaded the economies of many countries: '' by living and naturalizing people of Chinese descent. They hold many important companies and hold 60-80% of the economies of many countries. The threat of the CCP is too great and serious. The US, EU and International quickly ‘punish and destroy the zombies of the CCP. And quickly knock down and destroy the 'economy of the CCP'.🚨The CCP is a major, serious threat to the Security of the United States and the West and the World. Comprehensive economic embargo and liberated Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Hui Ningxia, Guangxi, Hong Kong, and Taiwan into independent countries, free from CCP aggression and oppression. Those were 2 fatal blows that killed the CCP.🇺🇸🇯🇵🇪🇺🇬🇧🇦🇺🇨🇦",1

"Sharing below written by a Malaysian YouTuber:<br><br>I’m from Malaysia. China has traded with Malaysia for 2000 years. In those years, they had been the world’s biggest powers many times. Never once they sent troops to take our land. China&#39;s admiral Zhenghe came to Malacca five times, in gigantic fleets, and a flagship eight times the size of Christopher Columbus’ flagship, Santa Maria. He could have seized Malacca easily, but he did not. In 1511, the Portuguese came. In 1642, the Dutch came. In the 18th century the British came.

The only time China expanded beyond their current borders was in Yuan Dynasty, when Genghis and his descendants Ogedei Khan, Guyuk Khan &amp; Kublai Khan concurred China, Mid Asia and Eastern Europe. But Yuan Dynasty, although being based in China, was a part of the Mongolian Empire. <br><br>Then came year 1800, the Century of Humiliation. Britain smuggled opium into China to dope the population, a strategy to turn the trade deficit around, after the British could not find enough silver to pay the Qing Dynasty in their tea and porcelain trades and the doping went on for over 30 years. After the opium warehouses were burned down and ports were closed by the Chinese in ordered to curb opium, the British started the Opium War I, which China lost. Hong Kong was forced to be surrendered to the British in a peace talk (Nanjing Treaty). The British owned 90% of the opium market in China, during that time, Queen Victoria was the world’s biggest drug baron. The remaining 10% was owned by American merchants from Boston. Many of Boston’s institutions were built with profit from opium. <br><br>After 12 years of Nanjing Treaty, the West started getting really really greedy.
